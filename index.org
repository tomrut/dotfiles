** Multimedia files conversion
** Playing music - command line
I used mpg123 to play my mp3 music files for few years. Recently when I've found fzf (fuzzy find) tool and I've got an idea to use it to quickly search for music and kick of playing songs.

Below I present three handy scripts I've created for quick finding and playing music:

*** FZF + mocp - [[[file:bin/p]]]
#+begin_src

#!/bin/bash
# depends on: fzf and mocp (music on console)

musicDir=~/Music
fzfSelectedDir="$(find $musicDir -type d|fzf)"
mocp -m "$fzfSelectedDir" -c -a "$fzfSelectedDir" -p
mocp
#+end_src
*** FZF + mpg123 + playlist creation
#+begin_src shell

#!/bin/bash
# depends on: fzf and mpg123 - create a list.m3u file in selected folder then passes it to play to mpg123

musicDir=~/Music
fzfSelectedDir="$(find $musicDir -type d|fzf)"
cd "$fzfSelectedDir"
find ./ -iregex '.*.mp.*' -type f -print > list.m3u
mpg123 --list list.m3u
#+end_src
*** FZF + mpg123
#+begin_src shell

#!/bin/bash
# depends on: fzf and mpg123 - need to do ctrl+c to go to next track

musicDir=~/Music
fzfSelectedDir="$(find $musicDir -type d|fzf)"
cd "$fzfSelectedDir"
find ./ -iname '*.mp3' -type f -print | mpg123 --list -

#+end_src

* Emacs
* Other
